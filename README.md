## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
- The variable considered the target for this model is 
- The variables considered to the be the festures for this model are
- The variables that are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data, are 

### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
- For my neural network model i selections X neurons, X layers and X activation functions.
- I was not able to achieve the target model performnace.
- To try to increase model performance, I ..
